# Praktikum - Login Form

This repository contains the source code for a simple login form built using HTML and CSS. The form allows users to input their username and password and includes buttons to submit or reset the form.

## Features

- Responsive design for different screen sizes using `meta viewport`.
- Styled using internal CSS for a clean and minimalist appearance.
- Includes:
  - Input fields for username and password.
  - A "Login" button to submit the form.
  - A "Reset" button to clear the input fields.

## Code Structure

The project consists of a single HTML file:

- `index.html`: Contains the markup and styling for the login form.

### HTML Structure

- `<head>`: Includes the page title, meta tags, and CSS styles.
- `<body>`: Contains the form structure, including a header, a description, and input fields for user login credentials.
- `.container`: A div that centers the form and ensures it is well-aligned on the page.
- `.form-group`: A class used to structure each input field and its corresponding label.

### Styling

CSS styles are defined within a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section, providing:

- Center alignment for the form and elements.
- Responsive padding and margin for a user-friendly interface.
- Defined widths for input fields to maintain consistency.

## Preview

Below is an example of how the login form looks in the browser:
